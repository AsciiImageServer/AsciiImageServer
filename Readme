The AsciiImagerServer is the number one place to store all of your precious images in their full true ascii glory.

It is suggested that you use the ExampleClient.py to talk to the server - there is example code of how to use it at the 
bottom of the python file.

The server can store images with and without password protection - for security reasons the password is randomly generated
each time the server starts. Those who require access will find a way to work out the password.
I have included one secret image with each build of the server.


To build the server simply run 'make' in the AsciiImageServer folder.

To start the server run './AsciiImageServer'



I've had a report that there are several vulnerabilities in the code but I can't find them.
Apparently it is possible to leak the password and, through seperate vulnerabilities,
get code execution on the servers host machine.
You have permission to audit the software, if you can work out whats wrong then please submit a patch request.
